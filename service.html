                <p id="TAIntro">I am a big believer that most humans can accomplish anything they care about (and that is known to be achievable by humans), given <b>access to the right information</b> and a <b>supportive environment</b> to learn and grow in. I hope my service and teaching in the past few years have been helpful with these! </p>

                        After COVID, I helped bring back the beloved Gems of TCS Reading Group and <a href="https://theory.cs.princeton.edu/theorylunch/">Theory Lunch</a> at Princeton. 
                        <!-- Gems of TCS is a student and postdoc only space where we share a paper we’re excited about or workshop early research ideas in a low-pressure setting. Theory Lunch brings in invited speakers, and we get the chance to chat with them one-on-one or over lunch or dinner afterward. Both also come with free food =) -->

                        During my PhD, I served as the point of contact at Princeton for <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/masters/masters.html">this crowdsourced spreadsheet</a> that provides basic information about master’s programs in theoretical computer science — it was also how I first got started in research.

                        I have served as a reviewer for various conferences and journals, including EC, STOC, SODA, ITCS, WINE and Operations Research. I have yet to serve on a huge conference like NeurIPS or ICLR, it seems pretty dramatic!

                <h2>Teaching</h2>
                <p id="TAIntro">I have TA'd for the following courses at Princeton University. For more advanced courses, I generally like to give students a space on the board to collaborate, and they barely needed me! </p>
